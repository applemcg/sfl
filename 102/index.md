[Table of Contents](../index.html)

This lessons adds debugging support functions to the SFL collection.
Features have **on** and **off** function handles which work from the 
command line and  within functions.

# What's Here

The sfl_list gets a replacement upgrade in this library.  It anticipates
the function collection called *function families*

## New Functions

+ debug -- debug{,_{,on,off}} 
* pause -- pause{,_{,on,off}}

# Maintenance, Direction

## Concepts

Five new concepts introduced and briefly explained to be expanded upon
in future editions of Shell Library lessons.

In addition to the previous lesson's new concepts:

1. local function,  within another definition
1. shell arrays in the Environment, here FUNCNAME
1. conditional expressions, OR and AND syntax: **||, &&**
1. reading from the terminal
1. intiialization, e.g.  *family*_**init**

Here the latter is a construct, a useful convention, which is not part
of of the bash shell.

## Explained

### The local function

### The shell array 

### Conditional expressions

### Reading from the terminal
