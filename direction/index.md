# Development Direction

To give guidance, let's lay out a direction

## Library conventions

+ finish 101
+ pre 102
++ cleanlib holds debug, myname, self-ref less smart names, 
++ functionlib holds smart directories, filenames, not superseded by
  app-like families
++ programlib absorbs utillib, well-used general functions
++ maintlib - the development process wrapup, etc.
