# Development Directio

To givme myself some guidance, let's lay out a direction


## Library conventions

+ cleanlib holds debug, myname, self-ref less smar names, 
+ functionlib holds smart directories, filenames, noto superceded by app-like families
+ programlib absorbs utillib, well-used general functions
+ maintlib - the development process wrapup, etc.
